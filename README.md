🔗 API Integration

Make sure your frontend connects to the backend via:

`
http://localhost:8000/api
`

Use Axios or Fetch to send requests from React components to Laravel routes.

💡 Pro Tips

- Run frontend and backend in separate terminals for smooth development
- Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to test your APIs
- Add JWT authentication for secure user sessions
- Deploy frontend to Vercel or Netlify, and backend to Laravel Forge, Heroku, or Railway
- Use .env files to manage environment variables securely
